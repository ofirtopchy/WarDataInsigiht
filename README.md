# WarDataInsights



## Overview

In October 7th, 2023, during the unfortunate events in Israel, I found myself in Berlin as part of a student exchange program. As my heart was broken and my mind was lost, I realized that contributing in some way or keeping myself busy might be a way to cope. This led me to pursue something I had wanted to do for a while – extracting insights from real data.



Every day, with automationI I ***scraped data*** (alrams) from the Home Front Command site, ran ***ETL*** procedures, and ***visualized*** the results.
